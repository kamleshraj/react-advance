In terms of solar energy, inverters play an important role in converting DC power generated by solar panels into usable electricity to be used for homes, businesses and the grid. This will allow efficient use of the sun's power and reduce dependency on traditional sources of energy, thereby helping to minimize carbon emissions. around USD 42.32 billion by 2032, poised to grow at a CAGR of 9.03% over the forecast period 2023 to 2032.",
